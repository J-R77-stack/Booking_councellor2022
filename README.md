# About

Mike Wilkins Councelling is a fictional website for a Councellor. The site can be viewed on mobile, desktop, laptop and tablets. Users can view the site in the usual way by navigating through the pages to learn more about the business. Users can view the Home, About, Services, Contact and Blog pages. The blog has not been set up yet so the users can sign up for an email for when it will be live. As well as this the User is able to create an account and then book, edit or delete appointments with the councellor. The User cannot use this service unless they have signed up for an account. Once signed in the User can view all their appointments using the My appointments link that appears in the nav bar. Site Admin Users can also create, edit and delete bookings in the Admin panel.

  ## Design
  The site is designed with five pages - Home, About, Contact, Book, Services and Blog. There are links  and a Nav bar provided  to connect to other parts of the site. Each page is fully responsive.
  
  I used the greyscale bootstrap theme from [Startbootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) and modified it to suit my ideas
  
  The main fonts used are Nunito, and Varela Round and the main colours are grey, green, black and white.

  # Features

  The site is fully responsive by using the Bootstrap Greyscale Theme. All features get resized correctly except for the appointment table in view_appointment.html when viewed on a mobile. However one is able to slide across to view and also tilt the device to look in landcape mode.

  The site is easy to navigate by using the navbar.

  ## Future Features
   1. Email sent to user when booked, edited or deleted appointment.
   2. Email sent to user when asked councellor a question in the contact form to say he'll be in touch.
   3. Set up interactive blog app with information about mental health issues.

## User Stories Evaluation
To ensure that the project fulfils the goals set out in the user stories:
  ### Site User Stories
  1. As a site user I can understand the purpose of the site so that I can learn more about the business with ease.
    * Once in the site the user is welcomed with an attractive and easy to navigate landing page with a fuctional Nav bar which takes them to the other pages of the site. The Hero Image holds an inspirational quote and a call to action button to book an appoointment straight away. The name of the councellor is easy to see in the top left hand corner. The user is also able to navigate from all pages to the councellors social media sites.  The user can click on the about services or contact tab in the nav bar to learn more about the business.

This will take them to the sign in page where they either can sign in using existing details or sign up for an account using the link (sign up) above the sign in form. They can only book an appointment if they're a registered user. The register link in the nav bar takes them to the sign up form and the log in link in the nav bar takes them to the sign in form as well. Once signed up or signed in the user is redirected back to the Home page where the Login and Register Links are replaced with Logout and Logged in as (username) There's also an new link called My appointments.

 # Credits 

 * Code Institutes two walk through projects were used as a base to build my own project. The 'Hello Django walkthrough' helped me to understand and build the CRUD fuctionalities and 'I think therefore I blog' helped me to understand and build the authentication and message fuctionality.

 * The Greyscale Bootstrap theme was used from [Startbootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) as the structure and style of the project and to also make it responsive.

 * I looked at and used images from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)

 * I researched datetimepickers for the booking form and settled on [Tempus Dominus](https://pypi.org/project/django-tempus-dominus/) which I found the easiest to impliment.

 * I used [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for Problems with code syntax and functionality. I found alot of good answers there.

 ## Acknowledgements

 * My Mentor for support and feedback
 * Code institute tutors for help with problems with my code
 * Friends and family for checking the fuctionality of the website.
